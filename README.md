# **Titanic_ML.ipynb**

This Jupyter Notebook delves into the fascinating Titanic disaster dataset, employing exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and insightful visualizations to uncover the factors that had a significant impact on passenger survival rates. Additionally, it ventures into the realm of machine learning by building and evaluating four different models to predict survival outcomes.

### Key Features:

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Acquaints you with the structure and content of the Titanic dataset.
Identifies missing values and implements appropriate cleaning strategies.
Analyzes the distribution of key variables (e.g., age, class, gender) across different survival groups.
Delves into relationships between variables using techniques like correlation analysis and visualization.

#### Data Visualization:
Leverages interactive charts and graphs to effectively represent the findings from the EDA, offering a clear visual understanding of the data.
Employs tools like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to reveal patterns and trends.

#### Machine Learning (ML) Modeling:
Guides you through the creation and training of four distinct machine learning models to predict passenger survival based on various features.
Explores different model types (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines) to identify the most effective approach for this dataset.
Evaluates the performance of each model using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses.
Provides clear explanations of the modeling process, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced data scientists.

#### Learning Outcomes:

Gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influenced passenger survival rates on the Titanic.
Develop practical skills in EDA, data visualization, and machine learning model building.
Evaluate the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms for a specific prediction task.
Target Audience:

Data analysts and scientists seeking to deepen their understanding of the Titanic dataset through EDA and visualization.
